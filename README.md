# If you want to contribute to the main programming aspect of the project 
First, download and install Visual Studio Code, this is an editor that can be used with many programming languages simultaneously. Next, you will want to install git and nodejs on your machine. Git is a local machine program that manages the github service / repos. Nodejs is the back-end server env I use as I have worked with it before. 
Once you have visual studio code open a new terminal and install npm `npm install -g npm`. 
Node package manager (npm) is used for importing packages that will handle the requests easily from the front-end part of the site. 
I would also recommend installing chocolatey which helps with version control on your local machine (also lets you know when npm and other packages need updating more reliably)

Now it's time to clone the repo into a local repo so you can run the server locally and access / develop using localhost:3030 as a url. Get the github pull extension on VSC and login. Ctrl + Shift + P opens the command pallete where you can search 'clone'. If you have logged in successfuly and been added as a contributer to the project then you should just be able to link the repo and it should clone it automatically.
